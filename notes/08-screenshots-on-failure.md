# Artifacts on Fail (Videos & Screenshots):

- Related files: [configs/playwright.config.ts](configs/playwright.config.ts) & `test-results` folder
- Whether or not videos & screenshots are captured as part of your tests depends on your test configuration.
- In [configs/playwright.config.ts](configs/playwright.config.ts), we've previously set video & screenshot to `off`.
- To capture videos & screenshots of failures, all you need to do is set the following:

```
video: 'retain-on-failure',
screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
```

- Now when a test fails, a `test-results` folder will be generated by default, & videos/screenshots will be added to it.
