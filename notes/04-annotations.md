# Annotations:

- `test.skip` skips this test.
- `test.only` only run this test. Note: If you add this annotation to multiple tests, all of the tests with this annotation will run.
- `test.describe` helps us group test cases together into logical groups or test suites. Simply place your `test`s into the `describe` function
